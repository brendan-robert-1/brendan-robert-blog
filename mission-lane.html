                  <p>Mission Lane's business is primarily credit cards. There are subsection of users who have a credit score that is too low to qualify
                    for a credit card. The "Credit Builder Loan" is a financial tool that these users can utilize to raise there credit score through monthly reporting to the three big credit
                    bureau's.

                <p>I was a Sr. Software Developer on this project where my primary responsbilities were to design, write, deploy, test, and monitor the back end SpringBoot Kotlin services supporting this financial 
                    product. There were numerous third party apis, including OFAC, KYC and other regulatory bodies that I needed to write apis for. This project focused on 
                    reusability and extensiblitiy. Many new financial products were slated to be developed that needed to make use of these same apis. My job was to make sure that we 
                    were writing clean code exactly once, with as much reuse as possible.

            <p>The primary tools and languages I used were Kotlin, SpringBoot, Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, GCP, Message Queues (Pub/Sub), and SQL</p>
            <p>Our user base for this product began with a pilot but quickly grew into the hundreds of thousands. Alerting, logging, and documentation were crucial for maintaining a user base of this size.</p>
